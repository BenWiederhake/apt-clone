Description: perl script to convert an addressbook to VCARD file format
 2vcard is a little perl script that you can use to convert the
 popular vcard file format. Currently 2vcard can only convert addressbooks
 and alias files from the following formats: abook,eudora,juno,ldif,mutt,
 mh and pine.
 .
 The VCARD format is used by gnomecard, for example, which is used by the
 balsa email client.
